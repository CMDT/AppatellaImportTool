# AppatellaResearchAPI
This project wraps the Appatella database with the 'research' API. This repo is intended to be a generic 'starter'. 
Use this as the foundation for research APIs on specific projects. This project offers authenticated access to a database export facility, with encryption.
The project requires use of the Authentication services provided by [Auth0](https://manage.auth0.com/). A full explanation of how to set up an Auth0 account for an instance of an Appatella Server can be found here:
